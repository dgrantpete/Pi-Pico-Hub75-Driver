### Running the Demo

The mip package includes only the library. To run the interactive demo:

1. Download [`main.py`](src/main.py) from this repository
2. Edit the pin configuration to match your wiring
3. Copy to your Pico's root directory
4. Reboot - the demo runs automatically

Alternatively, download the full zip from [Releases](https://github.com/dgrantpete/pi-pico-hub75-driver/releases/latest) which includes `main.py`.

## Usage

### Interactive Demo

The included `main.py` runs a visual demo on startup. Access the REPL to control it:

```python
# On boot, cycle() runs automatically — rotating through all effects

cycle()          # Cycle through all effects (default on boot)
balatro()        # Animated spiral effect
plasma()         # Classic plasma effect
fire()           # Doom-style fire effect
spiral()         # Rainbow spiral
stop()           # Stop the current effect

# Runtime display controls
brightness(0.5)      # Set brightness (0.0 - 1.0)
blanking_time(1000)  # Set blanking time in ns (reduces ghosting)
gamma(2.2)           # Set gamma correction exponent
refresh_rate(120)    # Set target refresh rate in Hz

print_pinout()       # Show wiring for your configuration
```

### Basic Usage

```python
from hub75 import Hub75Driver, Hub75Display
from machine import Pin

# Initialize driver
driver = Hub75Driver(
    address_bit_count=5,        # 5 for 64-row panels (1/32 scan)
    shift_register_depth=64,    # Panel width
    base_data_pin=Pin(0),
    base_clock_pin=Pin(6),
    output_enable_pin=Pin(8),
    base_address_pin=Pin(9),
    # Optional parameters (showing defaults):
    # brightness=1.0,           # Display brightness (0.0 - 1.0)
    # gamma=2.2,                # Gamma correction exponent
    # blanking_time=0,          # Dead time in ns to reduce ghosting
    # target_refresh_rate=120.0 # Target refresh rate in Hz
)

# Use the display wrapper for drawing
display = Hub75Display(driver)
display.fill(0x0000)           # Clear to black
display.rect(10, 10, 20, 20, 0xF800, fill=True)  # Red rectangle
display.show()                 # Update the display
```

### Direct Driver Access

For maximum performance, use the driver directly:

```python
# Create an RGB888 buffer (width * height * 3 bytes)
buffer = bytearray(64 * 64 * 3)

# Fill with your pixel data...

# Update display
driver.load_rgb888(buffer)
driver.flip()
```

## How It Works

The driver achieves CPU-free display refresh using the RP2040/RP2350's PIO and DMA peripherals:

**After `flip()`, the CPU is completely free** — the hardware takes over and continuously refreshes the display. Here's what's happening under the hood:

### The Pipeline

1. **Native C Conversion**: Your RGB data is transformed into 8 bitplanes. Each bitplane holds one bit of color depth for all pixels, packed as 6-bit values (R1,G1,B1,R2,G2,B2) for simultaneous dual-row output.

2. **Double Buffering**: Two frame buffers alternate roles. The CPU writes to the inactive buffer while DMA reads from the active one. `flip()` atomically swaps a pointer — no tearing, no blocking.

3. **DMA Chain**: Two DMA channels form a self-sustaining loop. The Data DMA streams bitplane data to the PIO, then chains to the Control Flow DMA, which reloads the Data DMA's read address and restarts the cycle.

4. **PIO State Machines**: Two state machines run in parallel, synchronized via hardware IRQs:
   - **Data SM**: Clocks pixel data into the panel's shift registers and controls the latch signal
   - **Address SM**: Outputs the row address and generates precise BCM timing delays

5. **Binary Code Modulation (BCM)**: Instead of traditional PWM, each bitplane is displayed with exponentially weighted timing (1:2:4:8:16:32:64:128). This creates 256 brightness levels per color channel with just 8 display passes per frame

## Panel Configuration Guide

HUB75 panels come in many sizes and scan rates. This section explains how to read your panel's specs and configure the driver.

### Reading Your Panel

Most panels have a label on the back with specs like:

```
64x64  1/32S  Indoor
```

The key values are:
- **Resolution** (e.g., `64x64`): Width × Height in pixels
- **Scan rate** (e.g., `1/32S`): How many rows are lit simultaneously

### Understanding Scan Rate

HUB75 panels use **multiplexing** — they don't light all rows at once. Instead, they rapidly cycle through addresses, lighting a fraction of rows at any moment.

*You can watch this happen in real time by lowering the data frequency below about 10 KHz with `driver.set_frequency(10_000)`; you'll see only a few rows lit up at a time.*

The scan rate tells you what fraction of rows are lit simultaneously:
- **1/32 scan**: 1/32 of the rows are lit at once (e.g., 2 rows on a 64-row panel)
- **1/16 scan**: 1/16 of the rows lit (e.g., 2 rows on a 32-row panel)
- **1/8 scan**: 1/8 of the rows lit (e.g., 2 rows on a 16-row panel, or 4 rows on a 32-row outdoor panel)

**Standard indoor panels** light 2 rows at a time. **Outdoor panels** with lower scan rates (1/4, 1/2) may light 4+ rows at a time for increased brightness.

**How to find your configuration:**
1. Check the panel label for scan rate (e.g., "1/32S")
2. Count the address pins (A, B, C, D, E) — this directly gives you `address_bit_count`

### The Two Key Parameters

```python
Hub75Driver(
    address_bit_count=5,      # ← Number of address pins on your panel
    shift_register_depth=64,  # ← Pixels clocked per address cycle
    ...
)
```

#### `address_bit_count`
The number of address lines your panel uses. Count the address pins on your panel's input connector (A, B, C, D, E).

| Address Pins | address_bit_count |
|--------------|-------------------|
| A, B, C      | 3                 |
| A, B, C, D   | 4                 |
| A, B, C, D, E| 5                 |

#### `shift_register_depth`
The number of pixels clocked into the panel per address cycle. For **standard indoor panels**, this equals the panel width.

**Outdoor panels** with lower scan rates (1/4, 1/2) may light more than 2 rows simultaneously. These panels often require clocking in more data per address — for example, `width × 2` pixels if 4 rows light at once. In this case, set `shift_register_depth` to the total pixels per cycle, not just the panel width.

### Common Panel Configurations

**Standard indoor panels** (2 rows lit at a time):

| Panel | Scan Rate | address_bit_count | shift_register_depth |
|-------|-----------|-------------------|----------------------|
| 32×16 | 1/8       | 3                 | 32                   |
| 32×32 | 1/16      | 4                 | 32                   |
| 64×32 | 1/16      | 4                 | 64                   |
| 64×64 | 1/32      | 5                 | 64                   |
| 128×64| 1/32      | 5                 | 128                  |

**Outdoor panels** (4+ rows lit at a time):

| Panel | Scan Rate | address_bit_count | shift_register_depth |
|-------|-----------|-------------------|----------------------|
| 64×32 | 1/8       | 3                 | 128                  |
| 64×32 | 1/4       | 2                 | 256                  |

For outdoor panels, `shift_register_depth = width × (rows_lit_at_once ÷ 2)`.

### Complete Configuration Example

For a **64×64 panel with 1/32 scan**:

```python
from hub75 import Hub75Driver
from machine import Pin

driver = Hub75Driver(
    address_bit_count=5,        # 5 address lines (A-E) for 1/32 scan
    shift_register_depth=64,    # 64 pixels wide
    base_data_pin=Pin(0),       # R1,G1,B1,R2,G2,B2 on GPIO 0-5
    base_clock_pin=Pin(6),      # CLK,LAT on GPIO 6-7
    output_enable_pin=Pin(8),   # OE on GPIO 8
    base_address_pin=Pin(9),    # A,B,C,D,E on GPIO 9-13
    data_frequency=25_000_000   # 25 MHz pixel clock
)
```

### Chaining Multiple Panels

For **horizontally chained** panels (e.g., two 64×64 panels side by side = 128×64):
- Increase `shift_register_depth` to total width (128)
- Keep `address_bit_count` the same

```python
# Two 64x64 panels chained horizontally
driver = Hub75Driver(
    address_bit_count=5,        # Same as single panel
    shift_register_depth=128,   # 64 + 64 = 128 pixels wide
    ...
)
```

### Troubleshooting

**Wrong colors or ghosting?**
- Try increasing `blanking_time` (e.g., `driver.set_blanking_time(1000)` for 1000 ns of dead time between rows)
- Try reducing `data_frequency` (e.g., 20 MHz instead of 25 MHz)
- Check your wiring — especially ground connections

**Only half the panel lights up or there are rows mixed up?**
- Ensure `shift_register_depth` matches your panel width or total pixels per cycle
- Check `address_bit_count`, you may need more address lines
- Verify your panel's actual scan rate matches your config

**Flickering or dim display?**
- Ensure adequate 5V power supply (panels can draw 2-4A at full brightness)
- Try adjusting `data_frequency`
- Check brightness with `driver.set_brightness(1.0)` to ensure it's at maximum

### Pin Configuration

Edit the pin constants to match your wiring:

```python
BASE_DATA_PIN = 0       # First GPIO for R1,G1,B1,R2,G2,B2 (consecutive)
BASE_CLOCK_PIN = 6      # First GPIO for CLK,LAT (consecutive)
OUTPUT_ENABLE_PIN = 8   # GPIO for OE
BASE_ADDRESS_PIN = 9    # First GPIO for address lines (consecutive)
```

The driver expects pins in consecutive groups:
- **Data pins**: 6 consecutive GPIOs (R1, G1, B1, R2, G2, B2)
- **Clock pins**: 2 consecutive GPIOs (CLK, LAT)
- **Address pins**: 3-5 consecutive GPIOs depending on scan rate (A, B, C, [D], [E])

### Hub75Display

FrameBuffer subclass for drawing to HUB75 panels. Compatible with MicroPython libraries that expect a FrameBuffer device (e.g. writer.py, CWriter).

- `show()` - Load buffer and flip
- `fill(color)` - Fill with RGB565 color
- `pixel(x, y, color)` - Set/get pixel
- `line()`, `hline()`, `vline()` - Draw lines
- `rect()`, `fill_rect()` - Draw rectangles
- `ellipse()` - Draw ellipses
- `text(string, x, y, color)` - Draw text
- `blit()`, `scroll()` - Buffer operations

## Current Limitations

HUB75 panels vary widely in their internal design. This driver works great with almost all indoor panels, but some panels use non-standard configurations that aren't yet supported.

### Currently Unimplemented Features

**Non-linear addressing** — Some panels don't use standard binary row addressing (where A=bit 0, B=bit 1, etc.). The address lines may be remapped or interleaved in panel-specific ways. See [this ESPHome documentation](https://esphome.io/components/display/hub75/) for examples of different addressing modes.

**Serpentine scan patterns** — Some panels clock data in alternating directions on each row. This requires pixel remapping that isn't currently implemented. The [PxMatrix library](https://github.com/2dom/PxMatrix) documents many of these scan patterns.

**Driver chip initialization** — Some LED driver chips require a special initialization sequence at power-up before they display correctly:

| Chip | Notes |
|------|-------|
| FM6124 | Requires init sequence + modified latch timing |
| FM6126A | 2 config registers, latch during last 3 bits |
| FM6127 | 3 config registers |
| MBI5124 | May need configuration for some panels |

If your panel stays dark or displays garbage, it may use one of these chips. Check for markings on the driver ICs on the back of your panel.

### Help Wanted

I'm happy to add support for these features if you need them, but I need your help since I can't test every panel type.

**If your panel doesn't work:**
1. [Open an issue](https://github.com/dgrantpete/pi-pico-hub75-driver/issues) with your panel specs (size, scan rate, driver chip if visible)
2. Be willing to test a few iterations with me
3. Together we can figure out what your panel configuration needs

The HUB75 ecosystem has a lot of variation, and I want this driver to work for as many people as possible, so your help is greatly appreciated!
